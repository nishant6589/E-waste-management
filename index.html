                    The main goal of this project is to reduce the E-Waste present in our surrounding. We know
                    that the decomposition of a E-waste take a long period of time. We are going to implement another
                    form of
                    way by using the RRR - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle methods. So ,we wanated to construct a linkage system
                    between
                    electronic waste generators and electronic waste management system. The waste generated can be
                    directly
                    handled by the management companies or plant. These also helps in segregation of the materials after
                    pre-processing the instruments.

                        The screen is cracked.
                        The owner wants an upgrade just for the sake of it.

                    <p class="text4">Upcycling is not the same as recycling.
                        “Recycling takes consumer materials — mostly plastic,
                        paper, metal and glass — and breaks them down so
                        their base materials can be remade into a new
                        consumer product, often of lesser quality,”
                        When you upcycle an item, you aren’t breaking down the materials.</p>

                        your used electronics. Lithium-ion batteries
                        in e-Waste is one of them .Some of these materials are toxic. We want to keep those toxins out
                        of landfills, where they can contaminate the soil and water .</p>

                        recyclable.When we usually think of biodegradable, we think of banana peels or apples; something
                        that breaks down and disappears after a few days. But, no one wants an iPhone that turns into
                        mush in your pocket .Green electronics, though, are durable during use yet made to biodegrade at
                        end-of-life. </p>
